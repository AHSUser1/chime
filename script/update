# script/update is used to update the project after a fresh pull.
#
# If you have not worked on the project for a while, 
# running script/update after a pull will ensure that everything 
# inside the project is up to date and ready to work.
#
# Typically, script/bootstrap is run inside this script.
# This is also a good opportunity to run database migrations 
# or any other things required to get the state of the app into 
# shape for the current version that is checked out.
