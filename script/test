# script/test is used to run the test suite of the application.
#
# A good pattern to support is having an optional argument that is a file path. 
# This allows you to support running single tests.
#
# Linting (i.e. rubocop, jshint, pmd, etc.) can also be considered a 
# form of testing. These tend to run faster than tests, so put them 
# towards the beginning of a script/test so it fails faster if there's a 
# linting problem.
# 
# script/test should be called from script/cibuild, so it should 
# handle setting up the application appropriately based on the environment. 
# For example, if called in a development environment, it should probably 
# call script/update to always ensure that the application is up to date. 
# If called from script/cibuild, it should probably reset the application 
# to a clean state.
